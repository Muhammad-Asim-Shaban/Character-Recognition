# EMNIST Character Recognition

This project demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to perform character recognition on the EMNIST dataset.

## Dataset

- **Name**: EMNIST Balanced
- **Source**: TensorFlow Datasets (`tensorflow_datasets`)
- **Description**: The EMNIST Balanced dataset contains handwritten characters including digits and letters (balanced across classes).

## Project Workflow

1. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets scikit-learn matplotlib numpy
